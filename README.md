# learn-copilotkit-agui

This is a simple example to learn [CopilotKit](https://www.copilotkit.ai/) and [AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com/introduction).
Please refer to the READMEs under each directory for detailed setup steps.

- Backend: [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)
- Frontend: [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md)

Note that the backend does not use an LLM; it simply returns responses based purely on AG-UI. If you use an LLM adapter, the abstraction becomes too strong and most of the AG-UI-specific code is hidden.
